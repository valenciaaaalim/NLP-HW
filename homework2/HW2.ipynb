    "One of the core challenges in NLP is how to represent language, the nature of which lies in its sequential structure of words. To address this, various sequence modeling architectures have been proposed. The most prominent models include the early RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory network), and the more recent Transformer. They differ primarily in how they processes information. RNN processes sequences step by step but struggles with long-range dependencies. LSTM introduces gating mechanisms to selectively retain information over long sequences. In contrast, Transformer relies on attention mechanisms to capture dependencies across all positions in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework provides a concise review of RNN and LSTM, with particular emphasis on how they model contextual information. It then shifts focus to attention mechanism, introducing its basic operations, its applications in sequence-to-sequence learning, and its multi-head variant."

    "## RNN and LSTM\n",
    "The primary challenge of processing a sequence $(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_T)$ lies in capturing contextual dependencies among elements. Although conventional feedforward neural networks treat each element independently, RNN introduces a hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_t$ that serves as an internal memory, allowing the model to retain and utilize information from previous time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "![rnn](rnn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple RNN with hidden size $h$ and input size $d$, the update of $\\mathbf{h}_t$ is:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{h}_t = \\tanh(\\mathbf{x}_t \\mathbf{W}_x + \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} \\mathbf{W}_h + \\mathbf{b})\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, $\\mathbf{x}_t \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d}$ represents the input at the current time step, which could be a word embedding or a feature vector. The term $\\mathbf{h}_{t-1} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{h}$ is the hidden state from the previous step. The matrices $\\mathbf{W}_x \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d \\times h}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_h \\in \\mathcal{R}^{h \\times h}$ transform the input and the previous hidden state into the hidden space, while $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathcal{R}^{h}$ is a bias term. The $\\tanh$ introduces nonlinearity into the model, squashing the combined input to values between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden state of RNN naturally propagates information through time. However, when the sequence becomes long, RNN faces difficulties such as vanishing and exploding gradients, which make RNN hard to learn long-term dependencies.\n",

The input gate $\\mathbf{i}_t$ controls how much of the new candidate memory $\\tilde{\\mathbf{c}}_t$ should be added to the cell state. The updated cell state $\\mathbf{c}_t$ combines retained memory and newly selected information. The output gate $\\mathbf{o}_t$ modulates the information from the cell state that will be exposed as the hidden state $\\mathbf{h}_t$. The element-wise multiplication $\\odot$ ensures selective gating, allowing the network to retain or suppress specific components of memory. The $\\mathbf{W}_f, \\mathbf{W}_i, \\mathbf{W}_o, \\mathbf{W}_c \\in \\mathcal{R}^{d \\times h}$ and $\\mathbf{U}_f, \\mathbf{U}_i, \\mathbf{U}_o, \\mathbf{U}_c \\in \\mathcal{R}^{h \\times h}$ are weight matrices of parameters conducting projections. The function $\\sigma$ represents the sigmoid activation, which outputs values between 0 and 1, controlling how much information flows through each gate.\n",

    "## Attention Seq2Seq\n",
    "Attention mechanisms can be effectively integrated into encoder-decoder architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning. Traditionally, in an RNN-based approach, all relevant information from the source sequence is encoded into a fixed-dimensional state representation by the encoder. However, rather than maintaining this state—represented by the context variable $\\mathbf{c}$ that summarizes the source sentence—as a fixed value, it can be dynamically updated. This update is based on both the original text (encoder hidden states $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$) and the previously generated text (decoder hidden states $\\mathbf{s}_{t’-1}$). As a result, we obtain an updated context variable $\\mathbf{c}_{t’}$ after each decoding time step $t’$. This approach allows the model to adapt the context dynamically, even for input sequences of length $T$, thereby improving the ability to handle long-range dependencies and capture more nuanced information from the source sequence.\n",
    "In this case, the context variable is the output of attention pooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{c}_{t'} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\alpha(\\mathbf{s}_{t'-1}, \\mathbf{h}_t) \\mathbf{h}_t.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We used $\\mathbf{s}_{t'-1}$ as the query, and $\\mathbf{h}_t$ as both the key and the value. Note that $\\mathbf{c}_{t'}$ is then used to generate the state $\\mathbf{s}_{t'}$ and to generate a new token."

    "### Question 5 [code] (10 points)\n",
    "Implement the RNN decoder in the ``Seq2SeqAttentionDecoder`` class. The decoder’s state is initialized using three components: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) the hidden states of the encoder’s last layer across all time steps, which are utilized as keys and values for the attention mechanism; \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) the hidden state of the encoder’s final time step at all layers, which initializes the decoder’s hidden state; and \n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) the valid length of the encoder to exclude padding tokens during attention pooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "During each decoding time step, the hidden state of the decoder’s final layer from the previous step is used as the query for the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism’s output is then concatenated with the input embedding to form the input for the RNN decoder, effectively guiding the generation process with context from both the source sequence and previous decoder outputs.\n",

    "Rather than relying on a single attention pooling operation, the queries, keys, and values can be transformed through $h$ independently learned linear projections. These $h$ projected queries, keys, and values are then processed in parallel through attention pooling. Afterward, the $h$ resulting attention outputs, known as ``heads``, are concatenated and passed through another learned linear projection to generate the final output. This architecture, referred to as ``multi-head attention``, allows each attention head to focus on different parts of the input, enabling the model to capture a wider range of information."

This means it can capture more accurate and diverse relationships because of the ability to focus on different aspects of the input data simultaneously, like encoding multiple relationships and nuances for each word. It thus has better contextual understanding and generate more human-like or accurate results, with higher efficiency. Single head attention calculates one set of attention scores based on a single set of queries keys and values, meaning it can only learn one type of relationship/perspective from the input at a time, which is too simplistic for context data and may not capture all nuances of the input."
